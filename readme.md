# HTMX Chat App - Go and SSE

A basic chat app built using Go using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for all frontend and UI interactions. The chat system is based on [Server Sent Events (SSE) ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) rather than Websockets.
