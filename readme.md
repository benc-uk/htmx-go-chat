# HTMX Chat App - Go and SSE

A basic multi user chat web app built using Go, and using HTMX for all frontend and UI interactions. The chat system is based on [Server Sent Events (SSE) ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) rather than Websockets.

The app looks, feels and interacts like a SPA, without full page reloads, but has zero lines of JavaScript
